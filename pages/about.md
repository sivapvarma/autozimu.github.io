## About This Site

This site is built to host some personal pages and posts, not to show,
but to log, to log my feeling and thinking within life.

Site powered by [ruhoh][] on [github][]. Sources are available at
[github][blog.sources]. Except where otherwise noted, all of my work is
licenced under [CC-BY-3.0][].

FYI, I am also available on [twitter][], [facebook][], [人人][], though
I always feel uncomfortable with those SNSs.

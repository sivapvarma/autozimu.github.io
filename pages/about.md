## About This Site

This site is built to host some personal pages and posts, not to show,
but to log, to log my feeling and thinking within life.

Site powered by [ruhoh](http://ruhoh.com/) on
[github](http://github.com). Sources are available at
[github](https://github.com/autozimu/autozimu.github.com). Except where
otherwise noted, all of my work is licenced under

FYI, I am also available on [twitter](https://twitter.com/autozimu),
[facebook](https://www.facebook.com/autozimu),
[renren](http://www.renren.com/252674076), though I'm quite unpleasant
with those SNSs.
